          based in India, with 5+ years of shipping real products.

            <p>
              I've spent the last five years in the intersection of product
              thinking and engineering execution. Most developers write code. I
              build products — from the initial idea discussion with a client to
              the final deployment on app stores and servers.
            </p>

            <p>
              My primary tool is Flutter, and I've pushed it further than most —
              building applications that run natively on Android, iOS, Windows,
              and macOS from a single codebase. But my work goes well beyond the
              frontend. I design and build the Node.js backends, architect the
              databases, integrate payment systems, and even program IoT
              hardware when the product demands it.
            </p>

            <p>
              What sets me apart isn't a technology — it's the approach. I think
              like a founder. When I work on a project, I care about the user
              experience as much as the code architecture. I ask "why are we
              building this?" before "how should we build this?" That mindset
              has led me to create products that genuinely work in the real
              world — not just in demo environments.
            </p>

            <p>
              I've built community platforms used by thousands of families,
              restaurant systems that operate entirely offline with IoT
              integration, and enterprise tools deployed across four operating
              systems. Each project pushed me into new territory — payments,
              offline-first architecture, real-time systems, hardware
              communication — and I chose to learn deeply rather than delegate.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I'm not building products, I'm researching. I experiment with
              new architectural patterns, explore edge cases in Flutter's
              rendering engine, and prototype ideas that might become the next
              project. The technology industry rewards curiosity, and I stay
              invested in understanding not just what works, but why it works.

              <h4 class="about-value__title">Founder Mindset</h4>
              <p class="about-value__desc">
                I treat every project as if it's my own company. Product
                decisions aren't just someone else's problem — they're my
                responsibility. This leads to better products.
              </p>

              <h4 class="about-value__title">Business → Tech Bridge</h4>
              <p class="about-value__desc">
                I speak business fluently. I translate client needs into
                technical architecture without losing nuance. This eliminates
                the communication gap that kills most projects.
              </p>

              <p class="about-value__desc">
                Frontend, backend, database, deployment, IoT — I don't hand off
                to someone else. Owning the entire stack means fewer integration
                bugs and faster shipping.
              </p>

              <h4 class="about-value__title">R&D as a Habit</h4>
              <p class="about-value__desc">
                I dedicate time to experimentation. Whether it's Dart server
                internals, ESP32 communication protocols, or new state
                management patterns — I invest in understanding before
                implementing.

              <h4 class="about-value__title">Offline-First Philosophy</h4>
              <p class="about-value__desc">
                Internet is a luxury, not a given. My systems are designed to
                work without connectivity — and sync gracefully when it returns.
                This isn't a feature, it's an architecture choice.

              <p class="about-value__desc">
                Perfect is the enemy of live. I ship production-ready products,
                gather real feedback, and iterate. Every product I've built is
                actively used — not sitting in a portfolio.
